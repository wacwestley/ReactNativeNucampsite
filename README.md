# React_Native_Nucampsite
This project is for the 4th month of the bootcamp.
It is completely written in React Native and uses Expo for all testing.
I took my knowledge of React and further learned to compress it and translate it for mobile apps.
App should take you to a browser with command "expo start".
From there select what emulator you have installed to continue.
Optionally you can run the Expo app from any smartphone.
Just download Expo from your app store to begin.
From the app you should be able to scan the QR code from the browser.
